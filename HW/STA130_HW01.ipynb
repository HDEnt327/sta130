    "   - **Definition**: An observation refers to a single row in your dataset. Each row represents one unique data point or entry.\n",
    "   - **In this dataset**: Each row represents a specific **villager** from the Animal Crossing game, with information about that villager such as their name, species, gender, birthday, and personality. \n",

    "### 2. **Variables**:\n",

    "### Conversation with ChatGPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** Now let's switch to a different dataset (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv), can you explain the discrepancies between the size of the dataset reported by df.shape and df.describe()?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT:** The discrepancies between the size of the dataset reported by `df.shape` and `df.describe()` in a dataset like the Titanic dataset can arise due to differences in what these functions report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s break this down:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`df.shape`**:\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This function returns the dimensions of the entire dataset, regardless of whether the columns contain numerical, categorical, or missing values.\n",
    "   - **Output**: `(rows, columns)`, where:\n",
    "     - `rows` is the total number of observations (records).\n",
    "     - `columns` is the total number of variables (attributes).\n",
    "   - **Example**: If `df.shape` outputs `(891, 15)`, this means there are 891 rows (observations) and 15 columns (variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **`df.describe()`**:\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This function provides descriptive statistics (such as mean, standard deviation, min, max, etc.) **only for numerical columns** by default. It only summarizes columns that are either integers or floats.\n",
    "   - **Output**: Summary statistics for the numerical columns in the dataset.\n",
    "     - **Count**: The number of non-missing values for each numerical column.\n",
    "     - **Mean**, **Standard Deviation**, **Min**, **Max**, etc. for each numerical column.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Note**: If you want `df.describe()` to include both **numerical and categorical** columns, you can use:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   df.describe(include='all')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is there a discrepancy?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Different Columns Considered**:\n",
    "   - `df.shape` considers all columns (numerical, categorical, etc.), while `df.describe()` (by default) only includes **numerical** columns. This can result in fewer columns being displayed by `df.describe()` compared to `df.shape`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Missing Data**:\n",
    "   - `df.describe()` reports statistics based only on **non-missing values**. If a column has missing values, the `count` reported by `df.describe()` for that column will be smaller than the total number of rows reported by `df.shape`.\n",
    "   - For example, if `df.shape` says there are 891 rows but a column has missing values, `df.describe()` might show a count less than 891 for that specific column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example for the Titanic dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the Titanic dataset\n",
    "url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv'\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv(url)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Shape of the dataset\n",
    "print(\"Dataset shape:\", df.shape)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Descriptive statistics\n",
    "print(df.describe())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Descriptive statistics for all columns, including categorical ones\n",
    "print(df.describe(include='all'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample Output:\n",
    "- **`df.shape`** might return `(891, 15)` â†’ 891 rows and 15 columns.\n",
    "- **`df.describe()`** might only show summaries for **numerical columns** like `age`, `fare`, `sibsp` (siblings/spouses aboard), and `parch` (parents/children aboard), but **ignore categorical columns** like `sex`, `embarked`, and `class`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the \"age\" column might have fewer than 891 values in `df.describe()` because some entries are missing, while `df.shape` will still report 891 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In summary:\n",
    "- **`df.shape`** reports the full size of the dataset (rows and columns, including all data types and missing values).\n",
    "- **`df.describe()`** only summarizes numerical columns by default, and reports only non-missing values for those columns, leading to discrepancies in counts and the number of columns summarized.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "I see! First of all, .shape directly gives me the full dimensions of the entire dataset, while .describe() gives summaries for columns individually. Since some of the columns include missing values, some of the columns would report count values that are less than 891. As seen in the following:"

    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conversation with ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** With that said, can you explain the different between attributes and methods, such as df.shape, which does not have a parentheses at the end, and df.describe(), which does have parentheses at the end\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT:** In Python, especially when working with libraries like `pandas`, itâ€™s essential to understand the difference between **attributes** and **methods**. This distinction explains why some operations (like `df.shape`) do not require parentheses, while others (like `df.describe()`) do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Attributes**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: An attribute is a property or characteristic of an object that stores a value. It's like a variable tied to an object. Attributes do not require parentheses because they represent data, not actions.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `df.shape`\n",
    "     - **What it does**: `df.shape` is an attribute of a pandas DataFrame that stores the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the dataset.\n",
    "     - **Why no parentheses**: Since `shape` is an attribute, it simply holds information and does not perform any computation. When you call `df.shape`, it retrieves and returns the stored data directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Other Examples**:\n",
    "     - `df.columns`: Returns the names of the columns.\n",
    "     - `df.index`: Returns the index (or row labels) of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Attributes are usually \"static\" in the sense that they describe the object and don't perform any dynamic calculations when accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Methods**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: A method is a function that belongs to an object. Methods perform some operation or computation on the object when called. You need parentheses to invoke (or call) a method, just like when calling a regular function.\n",
    "   - **Example**: `df.describe()`\n",
    "     - **What it does**: `df.describe()` is a method that performs a calculation on the DataFrame and returns a summary of descriptive statistics.\n",
    "     - **Why parentheses**: The parentheses are used to execute the method, i.e., to tell Python, \"perform this action.\" Methods often take arguments (which are passed inside the parentheses), although some methods, like `df.describe()`, can be called without arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Other Examples**:\n",
    "     - `df.head()`: Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame.\n",
    "     - `df.sum()`: Calculates the sum of values for each column.\n",
    "     - `df.isnull()`: Returns a DataFrame of the same shape, indicating which cells are missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Methods are \"dynamic\" because they perform actions or computations when you invoke them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences:\n",
    "| Aspect          | Attributes              | Methods                    |\n",
    "|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|\n",
    "| **Definition**  | Stores data or properties | Performs an action or operation |\n",
    "| **Parentheses** | No parentheses required | Requires parentheses to invoke |\n",
    "| **Example**     | `df.shape` (returns dimensions) | `df.describe()` (computes statistics) |\n",
    "| **Behavior**    | Retrieves a stored value | Executes a function or operation |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **Attributes** represent **data** tied to an object (e.g., `df.shape`), so they do not need parentheses.\n",
    "- **Methods** are **functions** that belong to an object (e.g., `df.describe()`), and they require parentheses because they perform some operation on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see something without parentheses (like `df.shape`), you're accessing a property or value of the object. When you see parentheses (like `df.describe()`), you're instructing Python to run a function associated with that object.\n",

    "## Question 6 (Starting Postlecture)\n",
    "\n",
    "The df.describe() method gives some statistics about columns that are analyzes, I have asked ChatGPT to give me a explanation of each of the key statistics it provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conversation with ChatGPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Me:** So since df.describe() gives summaries for numerical columns, can you give an explanation and definition for each of the statistics it analyses? Such as \"count\", \"mean\", \"std\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT:** Certainly! When you call `df.describe()` on a dataset with numerical columns, it provides a summary of key statistics for each column. Here's an explanation of each of these statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Count**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The number of **non-null** (non-missing) values in the column.\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: It tells you how many valid (non-`NaN`) entries are present in the column.\n",
    "   - **Example**: If a column has 891 total entries but 177 are missing, the count will be 714.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Mean**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The **average** value of the column.\n",
    "   - **Formula**: Sum of all non-null values divided by the count of non-null values.\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: It gives a central tendency of the data by averaging all valid values in the column.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In the Titanic dataset, if the `age` column has a mean of `29.7`, it means the average age of the passengers (for whom the age is known) is 29.7 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Standard Deviation (std)**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: A measure of the **spread** or **dispersion** of values in the column.\n",
    "   - **Formula**: It's the square root of the variance, which is the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: The larger the standard deviation, the more spread out the values are from the mean. A small standard deviation means the values are clustered closer to the mean.\n",
    "   - **Example**: If `std` for the `fare` column is high, it means passengers paid widely varying ticket prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Minimum (min)**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The **smallest** non-null value in the column.\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: It tells you the lowest value in the dataset for that column.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In the `age` column, if `min = 0.42`, it means the youngest passenger was 0.42 years old (about 5 months).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **25th Percentile (25%) / First Quartile (Q1)**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The value below which **25%** of the data falls.\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: It gives an idea of the lower quarter of the data distribution. This value is known as the **first quartile** (Q1).\n",
    "   - **Example**: If the 25th percentile for `fare` is `7.91`, it means 25% of passengers paid a fare of less than or equal to 7.91.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **50th Percentile (50%) / Median**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The value below which **50%** of the data falls (the **middle value** when the data is ordered).\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: This is the **median**, which is less affected by outliers than the mean. Half of the values are below this number, and half are above it.\n",
    "   - **Example**: If the median `age` is `28`, half of the passengers were younger than 28 years old, and the other half were older.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **75th Percentile (75%) / Third Quartile (Q3)**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The value below which **75%** of the data falls.\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: It gives an idea of the upper quarter of the data distribution. This value is known as the **third quartile** (Q3).\n",
    "   - **Example**: If the 75th percentile for `fare` is `31.0`, it means 75% of passengers paid a fare of less than or equal to 31.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Maximum (max)**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: The **largest** non-null value in the column.\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: It tells you the highest value in the dataset for that column.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In the `fare` column, if `max = 512.3292`, it means the highest ticket fare paid by any passenger was 512.33 (in whatever currency was used).\n",

    "## Question 7\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very important distinction between these two methods, df.dropna() automatically looks for null values in the dataset and removes the rows that contain missing values. While by default it removes rows, it can also be configured to remove columns by passing in an argument \"axis=1\". While the \"del df['col']\" operation removes a set column, which makes it useful when it is known which columns are not useful, or won't be used during the analysis that will be performed on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1\n",
    "\n",
    "With the differences between the two operations or methods, a use case in which using df.dropna() is more preferred when either a simple cleanup of the dataset is desired or there are not many missing values distributed between multiple rows, which could cause df.dropna() to remove a very large portion of the dataset. In that case --\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2\n",
    "\n",
    "-- (continued) the operation \"del df['col']\" would be more preferred, by locating the column where there are large amounts of missing values, and therefore that column could simply be removed as a whole. Alternatively, this operation could also be used to remove columns and variables that are no longer needed for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3\n",
    "\n",
    "And thus, combining what was explained earlier, if we were to use both df.dropna() and del df['col'] together, the latter should be preferred to be used first to remove columns with high amounts of missing values, so that when df.dropna() is executed, large portions of rows won't be removed due to that columns having lots of missing values.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Me:** Can you explain what df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe() would do\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT:** Certainly! The operation `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()` in pandas involves **grouping**, **selecting**, and **summarizing** data. Here's a breakdown of what each part of this command does:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`df.groupby(\"col1\")`**:\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This groups the DataFrame `df` by the unique values in **\"col1\"**.\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: Grouping means splitting the DataFrame into **subsets** based on the unique values of a specified column (in this case, \"col1\"). Each unique value in \"col1\" defines a separate group.\n",
    "   - **Example**: If \"col1\" represents \"gender\" (with values \"M\" and \"F\"), this will split the DataFrame into two groups: one for \"M\" (males) and one for \"F\" (females).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **`[\"col2\"]`**:\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This selects only the column **\"col2\"** from the grouped DataFrame.\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: After the DataFrame is grouped by \"col1\", this step focuses on analyzing only \"col2\" within each group.\n",
    "   - **Example**: If \"col2\" represents \"age\", this selects the \"age\" column from each group that was created by grouping based on \"gender\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **`.describe()`**:\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This computes summary statistics for **\"col2\"** within each group.\n",
    "   - **Explanation**: The `.describe()` method calculates a range of descriptive statistics (like `count`, `mean`, `std`, `min`, `25%`, `50%`, `75%`, and `max`) for \"col2\", but separately for each group defined by \"col1\".\n",
    "   - **Example**: If \"col2\" is \"age\" and \"col1\" is \"gender\", `describe()` will compute summary statistics for the \"age\" column **separately** for males and females. You will get two sets of descriptive statistics: one for males and one for females.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting It All Together:\n",
    "The command `df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()`:\n",
    "1. **Groups** the DataFrame by the unique values in **\"col1\"** (e.g., groups by gender).\n",

    "- **\"F\" group (females)**: The summary statistics for \"age\" include a count of 2 (there are 2 females), a mean age of 29.5, a standard deviation of 0.71, and so on.\n",
    "- **\"M\" group (males)**: The summary statistics for \"age\" show a count of 3, a mean age of 23.67, and a higher standard deviation of 1.53, indicating that the ages of males are more spread out than those of females.\n",
