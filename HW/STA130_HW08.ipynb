    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are CDTs? What Problems do they address?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification Decision Trees (CDTs) are a non-parametric, hierarchial model that attemps to split an original group of predictors into smaller groups** and maximizes homogeneity within each group, with each group represented as some categorical outcome variable. **CDTs attempt to do this by recursively applying decision rules** (sometimes called \"nodes\") that split the predictor entities into one subset or another, making each subset at each \"node\" as distinct as possible in terms of the target outcome variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "CDTs are non-parametric, meaning that the predictors and outcome variables **do not need to take some \"functional\" form**, such as linearity, quadratic, etc. This makes CDTs much more flexible in terms of what can be inputted as predictors as well as outcome variables, and **be more robust when predictors have interactions between them**. (We've seen in previous HWs that interactions can be quite complex and bothersome)\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, CDTs attempt to partition the data into \"regions\", with each region containing discrete predictor \"items\". Each \"region\" corresponds to a \"leaf node\" of the CDT, each represeting one of the outcome (target) variables. The way these regions are partitioned aims to minimize the \"impurity\" of the region, where higher \"purity\" meaning more correctly categorized predictors in each region.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CDTs are designed to and are mainly used to solve classification problems**, to categorize predictors (objects) into categories (or more technically called \"classes\") based on the characteristics of the predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the real world, CDTs are widely used in medical related fields, such as medical diagnosis.** A CDT can be used to identify whether or not a patient has a certain disease or not based on the characteristics of the patiet, such as symptoms, lab results, or even imaging results. In the modelling *(might be more commonly called \"training\" in the field of machine learning)* process (which we will demonstrate later), the algorithm chooses which characteristics are most useful in distinguishing between one class or another, and chooses the specific value(s) that separate the inputs into the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the root (top/first) node might separate patients into two groups based on whether or not they have a fever, then in subsequent nodes, the groups are further split based on other (maybe repeating) characteristics, such as, \"blood pressure > 140mmHg\" into one group, and \"blood pressure <= 140mmHg\" into another group. This process is continued until all patients have been categorized into one group or another, \"has the disease\" or \"does not have the disease\". Then, when we want to use the CDT to categorize a new patient, we simply follow the tree down the path with the patient's features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CDTs vs MLR models\n",
    "\n",
    "We've previously (in other HWs) looked at Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and seen how MLRs take in predictors and come up with a prediction of the outcome based on the predictor. We've also seen how MLR models can use both categorical data and numerical data as predictors and also output both types of data. This is similar to a CDT, where both types of data can be used to predict both types of data, but CDTs and MLR models are fundamentally different. CDTs go through the process of classification to come up with outcomes, while MLRs go through the process of regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "For regression, we are finding best values of **coefficients** to fit a **function** to a set of predictors, the final form of a regression model is a **function** (a **linear function** for MLR). This is fundamentally different compared to classification, where **partition (classification) rules** are defined to **partition** a predictor space (a group of predictors) into hierarchial regions, and the final result of a classification model is a **tree** like structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For MLR, when making a prediction, we input values for predictors, and calculate the final result by multiplying predictor variables with the coefficients. For CDTs, we make predictions by following the rules specified by each node in the tree, and follow the path down until the leaf nodes are reached, where a predictor is finally classified into a particular class."

    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, I want to first start by identifying what $TP$, $TN$, $FP$, $FN$ are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$TP$: True Positive, when the prediction is ****positive****, and the real outcome is also ****positive****.\n",
    "\n",
    "$TN$: True Negative, when the prediction is **negative**, and the real outcome is also **negative**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$FP$: False Positive, when the prediction is **positive**, but the real outcome is **negative**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$FN$: False Negative, when the prediction is **negative**, but the real outcome is **positive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model. It is the propotion of total predictions that the model got correct (both positives and negatives), it is calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A real word example could be spam email filters. For a spam email filtering model, a true positve is when a spam email is correctly identified as a spam, and a true negative is when non-spam email is correctly identified as non-spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "We value accuracy the most in this example the most because we care about the accuracy of both positive and negatives equally. It is equally important that spam email isn't identified as non-spam, as we really just don't want spam email, and that non-spam email isn't identified as spam, as we might not be able to see important email in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*This may not seen very obvious as of now, but examples for other metrics later we will talk about will show the difference.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity measures how well the model identifies positive cases. It is the proportion of actual positives that the model got correct, it is calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A real world example could be cancer detection, where a true positive is when a patient that has cancer is correctly identified as a cancer patient, and a false negative is when a patient that doesn't have cancer is falsely identified as a cancer patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "We value sensitivity in this example the most because we care about the model being able to correctly identify patients the most. Cancer patients are in urgent need of treatment, otherwise they may face severe deline in health and even death. Therefore correctly identifying patients is the utmost important thing for such a model, while the other cases, such as false positives, when falsely identifying a patient as a cancer patient, have much less consequences and/or have the least affect on stakeholders of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specificity\n",
    "\n",
    "Specificity measures how well the model identifies negative cases. It is the proportion of actual negatives that the model got correct, it is calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Specificity} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A real world example could be fraud detection, where a true negative is when a transaction that is non-fraudulent is correctly classified as non-fraudulent, and a false positive is when a non-fraudulent transaction is falsely identified as fraudulent. When true negatives are high, leading to higher specificity, the number of false negatives \n",
    "\n",
    "We calue specificity the most in this example when we care the most about ensuring that the customers being able to conveniently complete transactions. Therefore, we value the true negative rate the most, when true negatives are high, it means that most of the non-fraudulent transactions are correctly identified, and the transaction is completed for the customer without obstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Precision\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision measures accuracy of positive predictions. It is the proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct, it is calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A real world example could be predicting crime risk of individuals, where a true positive is when a person is correctly identified as likely to commit a crime(s), and a false positive is when a person is wrongly identified as likely to commit a crime(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "We value precision in this example the most because we want to ensure that those who are actually going to commit crimes are identified and flagged (possibly put under surveilance), so that they do not continuously pose a risk to society by remaining not flagged. As the same for other cases, the consequences of not being able to identify a person with high crime risks are far higher than other outcomes, such as falsely flagging a person with low crime risks."

So, when making a prediction, the model will look at the price variable, if it satisfies the condition, it is put into the corresponding node on the next level, which, may be a leaf node, or in our example, are another level of conditional nodes that split the predictors once again.\n",

    "This CDT model is much more complicated than the previous one due to two main changes made to how the model is trained. First of all, we have changed the predictor variables the model uses to make predictions. In `clf`, we only used the `List Price` variable, while in `clf2`, we have also used `NumPages`, `Thick`, and `List Price` in our predictors. When fitting our model, we have changed the maximum depth of the tree (which are the maximum number of nodes, excluding leaf nodes, there are vertically) from 2 in `clf` to 4 now in `clf2`, this makes the tree have more chances to make decisions based on more features of the predictors, and therefore make better predictions due to the higher specificity (this is not referring to the specificity metric, but rather how specific the predictors used describe the observations).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this new model, the `x[0]` variable is `NumPages`, `x[1]` is `Thick`, and `x[2]` is `List Price`. The model is looks at all these tree variables to make decisions. For example, in the root node of the tree, it looks at the `NumPages` variable to split the predictor spaces into two regions, and then on the `True` side, it uses the `NumPages` variable, while the `False` side uses the `Thick` variable. This is once again repeated, but with each node using difference variables to make decisions, until it reaches the leaf node where each predictor in the predictor space is cateogorized into one group or another.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that, although having more \"depth\" in the CDT model can lead to higher accuracy, which may seen good, it has the same risk of using complex specification in multiple linear regression, **overfitting**. When we use so much complexity to build a MLR model that it is too much for the available data, the model essentially \"memorizes\" the data that it was trained on, resulting in bad generalizability and perform bad when fed with data the model hasn't seen before. The same applies to CDT trees, as when enough depth is allowed for the CDT, we eventually may end up with the tree so accurately classifying the predictors that we have one node for each predictor, and when we input data into the CDT that it hasn't seen before, it will not be able to correctly predict the outcome."

    "This is a confusion matrix, it is **a way of visually representing how well the model is performing**, based on the results of the predictions made by the model, and the actual outcome of the corresponding predictors. From the confusion matrix, we can see each of the four states of the prediction made by the CDT, $TP$, $TN$, $FP$, and $FN$. Each box in the confusion matrix represents one state, and the number in the box represents how many of the predictions the model made belong to this state. In our example, the state of being `True` is for being a hard cover book, therefore, to read the confusion matrix, the bottom right, where the label `Hard` is on both axis, is the $TP$ state, where the model correctly identifies hard cover books. Consequently, $TN$ state is the top left, $FP$ is top right, and $FN$ is bottom left.\n",

The goal for creating a predictive model is to that it can **generalize and predict accurately for any data** that is inputted into it, therefore, **we should always use new data that the model has not seen before to perform testing and evaluations,** to prevent issues such as **overfitting**."
